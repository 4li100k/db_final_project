This is an e-shop website running on a Node.js server. Users can view items, add them to cart, remove them or make a purchase. Data are saved in cloud-hosted databases, Microsoft SQL (Azure) and Neo4j (graphstory).

The emphasis is on the back-end part, the front-end is minimal and mostly for easier testing purposes.
